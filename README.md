# awesominds
Camosun College instructor Marty Donatelli developed the idea of the Game-Based Learning Project. The GBLP team worked closely with Marty to develop Awesominds — a single-player, online game that uses course content and has an interface that is easy for students and instructors to use.

The testing effect is a proven technique to improve learning; students prepare for tests by taking practice tests. Unfortunately, student motivation to take tests is typically low. A digital game that has the player answer questions on course material can be an effective way to prepare for tests, but games like these are rare for college-level courses.

With the completion of this prototype, the team has helped lay groundwork for a number of future goals, including potential college-wide rollout and integration with Camosun’s learning management system, Desire2Learn.
